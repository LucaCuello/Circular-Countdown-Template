# Circular countdown template

## INFO

**CSS & JS only**

I was making a pomodoro app and wanted to make a circle countdown but couldn't find a simple way to do it, there were some tutorials but not exactly what I wanted, or they were just a little overcomplicated. I made this template hoping to help people in a similar situations.
